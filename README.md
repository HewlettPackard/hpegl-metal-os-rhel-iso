# Overview

This GitHub repository contains the script files, template files, and documentation for creating an RHEL service for HPE Bare Metal from an RHEL install .ISO file.  By building a custom image via this process, you can control the exact version of RHEL that is used and modify how RHEL is installed via a kickstart file.  Once the build is done, you can add your new service to the HPE Bare Metal Portal and deploy a host with that new image.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **This RHEL recipe has been shown to work with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Oracle Linux (OL), and Rocky Linux.**

# Example of manual build for reference

Workflow for Building Image:

![image](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpegl-metal-os-rhel-iso/assets/90067804/e2a198c4-96f1-4c1c-8fa0-4ac8c730857e)


**Prerequisites:**
```
1. You will need a Web Server with HTTPS support for storage of the HPE Base Metal images.
2. The Web Server is anything that:
    A. you have the ability to upload large OS image (.iso) to, and
    B. is on a network that will be reachable from the HPE On-Premises Controller.
       When an OS image service (.yml) is used to create an HPE Bare Metal Host, the HPE Bare Metal
       OS image (.iso) will be downloaded via the `secure_url` mentioned in the service file (.yml).
3. IMPORTANT:
   The test `glm-test-service-image.sh` script is to verify the HPE Bare Metal OS image (.iso).
   To run this test, edit the file `./glm-build-image-and-service.sh` to set the required
   Web Server-related parameters, listed below:
      +----------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | | File `./glm-build-image-and-service.sh`
      | |   <1> WEB_SERVER_IP: IP address of web server to transfer ISO to (via SSH)
      | |       Example: WEB_SERVER_IP="10.152.3.96"
      | |   <2> REMOTE_PATH:   Path on web server to copy files to
      | |       Example: REMOTE_PATH="/var/www/images/"
      | |   <3> SSH_USER:      Username for SSH transfer
      | |       Example: SSH_USER_NAME="root"
      | | Note: Add your Linux test machine's SSH key to the Web Server
      | +--------------------------------------------------------------------------
      +----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   In this document, for the manual build example:
   A. a local Web Server "https://10.152.3.96" is used for the storage of OS images (.iso).
   B. we are assuming that the HPE Bare Metal OS images will be kept in: https://10.152.3.96/images/<.iso>
4. Linux machine for building OS image:
   A. Image building has been successfully tested with the following list of Ubuntu OS and its LTS versions:
      Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (focal)
      Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (jammy)
      Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (noble)
   B. Install supporting tools (git, xorriso, and isomd5sum)
```

Step 1. Source code readiness

A. Clone the GitHub Repo `hpegl-metal-os-rhel-iso`
```
git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpegl-metal-os-rhel-iso.git
```
B. Change the directory to `hpegl-metal-os-rhel-iso`

Step 2. Download the RHEL .ISO image to your local build environment via what ever method you prefer (Web Browser, etc)

For example, we will assume that you have downloaded RHEL-9.0.0-20220810.0-x86_64-HPE.iso into the local directory.

Step 3. Run the script [glm-build-image-and-service.sh](glm-build-image-and-service.sh) to generate an output Bare Metal image .ISO as well as Bare Metal Service .yml:

Example: Run the build including artifact verification
```
./glm-build-image-and-service.sh \
  -v 9.0 \
  -p https://10.152.3.96 \
  -r qPassw0rd \
  -i RHEL-9.0.0-20220810.0-x86_64-HPE.iso \
  -o RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso \
  -s RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml
```
Example: Run the build excluding artifact verification
```
./glm-build-image-and-service.sh \
  -v 9.0 \
  -p https://10.152.3.96 \
  -r qPassw0rd \
  -i RHEL-9.0.0-20220810.0-x86_64-HPE.iso \
  -o RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso \
  -s RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml \
  -x true
```

Example test result for reference:
```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| | This build has generated a new HPE Bare Metal RHEL service/image
| | that consists of the following 2 new files:
| |     RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso
| |     RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml
| |
| | To use this new Bare Metal RHEL service/image in the HPE Bare Metal, take the following steps:
| | (1) Copy the new .ISO file (RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso)
| |     to your web server (https://10.152.3.96)
| |     such that the file can be downloaded from the following URL:
| |     https://10.152.3.96/images/RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso
| | (2) Add the Bare Metal Service file (RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml) to the HPE Bare Metal Portal
| |     (https://client.greenlake.hpe-gl-intg.com/). To add the HPE Bare Metal Service file,
| |     sign in to the HPE Bare Metal Portal and select the Tenant by clicking "Go to tenant".
| |     Select the Dashboard tile "Metal Consumption" and click on the Tab "OS/application images".
| |     Click on the button "Add OS/application image" to Upload the OS/application YML file.
| | (3) Create a Bare Metal host using this OS image service.
| +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Step 4. Copy the output Bare Metal image .ISO to the Web Server.

Step 5. Add the Bare Metal service .yml file to the appropriate Bare Metal portal.

To add the Bare Metal service .yml file, sign in to the HPE Bare Metal Portal and select the Tenant by clicking "Go to tenant".
Select the Dashboard tile "Metal Consumption" and click on the "OS/application images" tab.
Click on the button "Add OS/application image" to upload this service .yml file.

Step 6. Create a new Bare Metal host using this OS image service.

To create a new Bare Metal host, sign in to the HPE Bare Metal Portal and select the Tenant by clicking "Go to tenant".
Select the Dashboard tile "Metal Consumption" and click on the tab "Compute groups". Further, create a host using the following steps:
a. First, create a Compute Group by clicking the "Create compute group" button and fill in the details.
b. Create a Compute Instance by clicking the "Create compute instance" button and fill in the details.


# Building RHEL image

These are the high-level steps required to generate the Bare Metal RHEL service:
* Set up a Linux system with 20-40GB of free file system space for the build
* Set up a local file transfer/storage tool (E.g. **Local Web Server with HTTPS support**) that Bare Metal can reach over the network.
  * For **unsecured Web Server access**, please refer to the [Hosting](Hosting.md) for additional requirements, listed below:
    *  A. **HTTPS** with certificates signed by **publicly trusted Certificate authority**, and
    *  B. **Skip** the hostâ€™s **SSL certificate verification**.
  * For **Web Server running behind the Firewall**, the Web Server IP address and Port has to be whitelisted in the **rules** and **Proxy**.
* Install Git Version Control (git) and other ISO tools (xorriso and isomd5sum)
* Downloading recipe repo from GitHub
* Download a RHEL .ISO file
* Build the Bare Metal RHEL image/service

These are the high-level steps required to use this built Bare Metal RHEL service/image on Bare Metal:
* Copy the built Bare Metal RHEL .ISO image to your web server
* Add the Bare Metal RHEL .YML service file to the appropriate Bare Metal portal
* In Bare Metal, create a host using this RHEL image service

## Setup Linux system for imaging build

These instructions and scripts are designed to run on a Linux system.
Further, these instructions were developed and tested on a Ubuntu 20.04 VM, but they should work on other distros/versions.
The Linux host will need to have the following packages installed for these scripts to run correctly:

Packages      | Description
------------- | ---------------------
git           | a source code management tool.
xorriso       | a RockRidge filesystem manipulator, libburnia project.
isomd5sum     | utilities for working with md5sum implanted in ISO images.

On Ubuntu 20.04 VM, the necessary packages can be installed with:

```
sudo apt install git xorriso isomd5sum
```

> [!NOTE]  
> You must also have sudo (superuser do) capability so that you can mount the RHEL ISO
> and copy the files from it to generate a new RHEL .ISO file for Bare Metal.

The resulting RHEL .ISO image file from the build, needs to be uploaded to a web server that
the HPE On-Premises Controller can access over the network.  More about this later.

## Downloading recipe repo from GitHub

Once you have an appropriate Linux environment setup, then download this recipe from GitHub
for building the HPE Bare Metal RHEL by:

```
git clone https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpegl-metal-os-rhel-iso.git
```

## Downloading RHEL .ISO file

Next, you will need to manually download the appropriate RHEL .ISO onto the Linux system.
This RHEL recipe has been successfully tested with the following list of RHEL distributions and its derivatives:
* RHEL 8.6
* RHEL 8.7
* RHEL 9.0
* RHEL 9.1
* RHEL 9.2
* RHEL 9.4
* RHEL 9.5
* Oracle Linux 8.6
* Oracle Linux 8.9
* Oracle Linux 9.3
* Oracle Linux 9.4
* Rocky Linux 8.8
* Rocky Linux 9.0

> [!NOTE]  
> This recipe should work on other RHEL or RHEL-based distros that support the same kickstart and .ISO construction as the recent version of RHEL.  
> **For Secure Boot, the user must have RHEL 9.1 or later.**

## Building the Bare Metal RHEL image and service

At this point, you should have a Linux system with:
* a copy of this repo
* a standard RHEL .ISO file

We are almost ready to do the build, but we need to know something about your environment.
When the build is done, it will generate two files:
* a Bare Metal modified RHEL .ISO file that needs to be hosted on a web server.
  It is assumed that you have (or can set up) a local web server that Bare Metal can reach over the network.
  You will also need login credentials on this Web Server so that you can upload the files.
* a Bare Metal service .YML file that will be used to add the RHEL service to the portal.
  This .YML file will have a URL to the Bare Metal modified RHEL .ISO file on the web server.

The build needs to know what URL can be used to download the Bare Metal modified RHEL .ISO file.
We assume that the URL can be broken into 2 parts: \<image-url-prefix\>/\<bare-metal-custom-rhel-iso\>

If the image URL can not be constructed with this simple mechanism, then you probably need to
customize this script for a more complex URL construction.

So you can run the build with the following command line parameters:

```
./glm-build-image-and-service.sh \
    -i <rhel-iso-filename> \
    -v <rhel-version-number> \
    -r <rhel-rootpw> \
    -p <image-url-prefix> \
    -o <rhel-baremetal-iso> \
    -s <rhel-baremetal-service-file>
```

When an RHEL host is created in the Bare Metal portal, the HPE On-Premises Controller will pull down this Bare Metal modified RHEL .ISO file.

### glm-build-image-and-service.sh - the top-level build script

This is the top-level build script that will take an RHEL install ISO and generate an RHEL service .yml file that can be imported as a Host OS into a Bare Metal portal.

This script 'glm-build-image-and-service.sh' does the following steps:
* process command line arguments.
* Customize the RHEL .ISO so that it works for Bare Metal.  Run: `glm-image-build.sh`
* Generate the Bare Metal service file for this Bare Metal image that we just generated. Run: `glm-service-build.sh`

Usage:

```
./glm-build-image-and-service.sh \
    -i <rhel-iso-filename> \
    -v <rhel-version-number> \
    -r <rhel-rootpw> \
    -p <image-url-prefix> \
    -o <rhel-baremetal-iso> \
    -s <rhel-baremetal-service-file>
```

Command Line Options                | Description
------------------------------------| -----------
-i \<rhel-iso-filename\>            | local filename of the standard RHEL .ISO file that was already downloaded. Used as input file.
-v \<rhel-version-number\>          | a x.y RHEL version number.  Example: -v 7.9
-r \<rhel-rootpw\>                  | clear-text password for the root user. <br> **_NOTE:_**  <br> 1. Later, this clear-text password is encrypted and the Service file (.yml) shows an encrypted password in the kick-start `/KS.cfg` file. <br> 2. This clear-test password will be visible in the build machine's command history. You may identify the command number you want to remove and then use `history -d` followed by the command number.
-o \<rhel-baremetal-iso\>           | local filename of the Bare Metal modified RHEL .ISO file that will be output by the script.  This file should be uploaded to your web server.
-p \<image-url-prefix\>             | the beginning of the image URL (on your web server). Example: -p https://10.152.3.96.
-s \<rhel-baremetal-service-file\>  | local filename of the Bare Metal .YML service file that will be output by the script.  This file should be uploaded to the Bare Metal portal.
-x \<skip-test>                     | [optional] skip the test with "-x true". <br> **_NOTE:_**  <br> By default, this script will run the test [glm-test-service-image.sh](glm-test-service-image.sh) script to verify that the upload was correct, and the size and checksum of the ISO match what is defined in the YML.

> [!NOTE]  
> The users of this script are expected to copy the \<rhel-baremetal-iso\> .ISO file to your web server
> such that the file is available at this constructed URL: \<image-url-prefix\>/\<rhel-baremetal-iso\>.
> The Bare Metal service .YML will assume that the image file will be available at a URL constructed with \<image-url-prefix\>/\<rhel-baremetal-iso\>.

### glm-image-build.sh - Customize RHEL.ISO for Bare Metal

This script `glm-image-build.sh` will repack an RHEL .ISO file for a Bare Metal RHEL install service that uses Virtual Media to
get the installation started.

The following changes are being made to the RHEL .ISO:
  1. configure to use a kickstart file on the iLO vmedia-cd and to pull the RPM packages (stage2) over vmedia
  2. setup for a text-based install (versus a GUI install)
  3. set up the console to the iLO serial port (/dev/ttyS1)
  4. eliminate the 'media check' when installing so that we get faster deployments (and parity with TGZ installs)

The RHEL .ISO is configured to use a kickstart file on the iLO vmedia-cd by adding the 'inst.ks=hd:sr0:/ks.cfg' option in
GRUB (used in UEFI) and isolinux (used in BIOS) configuration files. This option configures the RHEL installer to pull the
kickstart file from the root of the cdrom at /ks.cfg.  This kickstart option is setup by modifying the following files
on the .ISO:
  isolinux/isolinux.cfg for BIOS
  EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg for UEFI

Usage:
```
glm-image-build.sh \
    -i <rhel.iso> \
    -o <rhel-baremetal.iso>
```

Command Line Options            | Description
------------------------------- | -----------
-i \<rhel.iso\>                 | Input RHEL .ISO filename
-o \<rhel-baremetal.iso\>       | Output Bare Metal RHEL .ISO file

Example:

```
sudo ./glm-image-build.sh \
    -i RHEL-9.0.0-20220810.0-x86_64-HPE.iso \
    -o RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso
```

Here are the detailed changes that are made to the RHEL .ISO:
* change the default timeout to 5 seconds (instead of 60 seconds)
* change the default menu selection to the 1st entry (no media check)
* add the 'init.ks=hd:sr0:/ks.cfg' option to the various lines in the file
* also setup the serial console to ttyS1 (iLO serial port) with 115200 baud
* remove the 'quiet' option so the user can watch kernel loading and use to triage any problems

### glm-service-build.sh - Generate Bare Metal .YML service file

This script `glm-service-build.sh` generates a Bare Metal OS service .yml file appropriate for uploading to a Bare Metal portal(s).

Usage:
```
glm-service-build.sh \
    -s <service-template> \
    -o <service_yml_filename> \
    -c <svc_category> \
    -f <scv_flavor> \
    -v <svc_ver> \
    -d <display_url> \
    -u <secure_url> \
    -i <local_image_filename> [ -t <os-template> ]
```

Command Line Options        | Description
--------------------------- | -----------
-s \<service-template\>     | service template filename (input file)
-o \<service_yml_filename\> | service filename (output file)
-c \<svc_category\>         | the Bare Metal service category
-f \<scv_flavor\>           | the Bare Metal service flavor
-v \<svc_ver\>              | the Bare Metal service version
-d \<display_url\>          | used to display the image URL in the user interface
-u \<secure_url\>           | the real URL to the image file
-i \<local_image_filename\> | a full path to the image for this service. Used to get the .ISO sha256sum and size.
[ -t \<os-template\> ]      | info template files. 1st -t option should be %CONTENT1% in service-template. 2nd -> %CONTENT2%.

Example:
```
./glm-service-build.sh \
    -s /tmp/glm-service.cfg.5k70efrzd \
    -o RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml \
    -c linux \
    -f RHEL \
    -v 9.0-20240328-BYOI \
    -u https://10.152.3.96/images/RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso \
    -d RHEL-9.0.0-20220810.0-x86_64-HPE.iso \
    -i RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso \
    -t glm-kickstart.cfg.template \
    -t glm-cloud-init.template
```

### glm-test-service-image.sh - Verify the Bare Metal OS image

This script [glm-test-service-image.sh](glm-test-service-image.sh) will verify that the OS image referred to in a corresponding Bare Metal OS service. yml is correct.

Usage:
```
glm-test-service-image.sh <rhel-baremetal-service-file>
```

Command Line Options             | Description
-------------------------------- | -----------
\<rhel-baremetal-service-file\>  | service filename (output file)

Example:
```
./glm-test-service-image.sh RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml
```

# Customizing RHEL image

The RHEL image/service can be customized by:
* Modifying the way the image is built
* Modifying the RHEL kickstart file

## Modifying the way the image is built

Here is a description of the files in this repo:

## Modifying the RHEL kickstart file

The RHEL kickstart file is the basis of the automated install of RHEL supplied by this recipe.
Many additional changes to either of the kickstart files are possible to customize to your needs.

# Using the RHEL service and image

## Adding RHEL service to Bare Metal portal

When the build script completes successfully, you will find the following instructions to add this image to your HPE Bare Metal portal.

For example:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| | This build has generated a new HPE Bare Metal RHEL service/image
| | that consists of the following 2 new files:
| |     RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso
| |     RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml
| |
| | To use this new Bare Metal RHEL service/image in the HPE Bare Metal, take the following steps:
| | (1) Copy the new .ISO file (RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso)
| |     to your web server (https://10.152.3.96)
| |     such that the file can be downloaded from the following URL:
| |     https://10.152.3.96/images/RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.iso
| | (2) Add the Bare Metal Service file (RHEL-9.0-BareMetal.yml) to the HPE Bare Metal Portal
| |     (https://client.greenlake.hpe-gl-intg.com/). To add the HPE Bare Metal Service file,
| |     sign in to the HPE Bare Metal Portal and select the Tenant by clicking "Go to tenant".
| |     Select the Dashboard tile "Metal Consumption" and click on the Tab "OS/application images".
| |     Click on the button "Add OS/application image" to Upload the OS/application YML file.
| | (3) Create a Bare Metal host using this OS image service.
| +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Follow the instructions as directed!

## Creating an RHEL Host with RHEL Service

Create a host in Bare Metal using this OS image service.

## Triage of image deployment problems

After you have created your custom RHEL image/server and created a host using this new service, you will want to monitor the deployment so for the first few times, make sure things are going as expected.
Here are some points to note:
  * This image/service is set to output to the serial console during RHEL deployment and watching the serial console is the easiest way to monitor the RHEL deployment/installation.
  * HPE GreenLake Metal tools do not monitor the serial port(s) at this time so if an error is generated by the RHEL installer, the Bare Metal tools will not know about it.
  * Sometimes for more difficult OS deployment problems you might want to gain access to the servers iLO so that you can monitor it that way. See your Bare Metal administrator.

## Known Observations and Limitations

<1> Host readiness for the user to log in  
After the host is created successfully, the Portal UI shows progress 100%.  
However, the host os is still booting up in the background, resulting in user login (serial console login and SSH login) being delayed by 2 to 3 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

This section covers common problems and solutions for RHEL/Oracle Linux issues.  
<1> How to Login using Serial Console  
Linux kernels can output information including the login prompt to serial ports. Users can open the serial console window to log in to the host.  
Example for reference:   
```
Session established.
Connecting...
Connected.
     <<Press Enter to have Login Prompt>>
Oracle Linux Server 8.9
Kernel 5.15.0-200.131.27.el8uek.x86_64 on an x86_64
                                                                                                                                            
nb-ol8 login: root
Password:
Last login: Mon Aug 12 23:40:51 on ttyS1
[root@nb-ol8 ~]#
```
<2> The serial console can freeze and stop taking input.  
The user needs to access the host via SSH and run the following steps to resume the console access:

## OS License

RHEL is a licensed software and users need to have a valid license key from RedHat to use RHEL.
This install service does nothing to set up an RHEL license key in any way.
Users are expected to manually use RHEL tools to set up an RHEL license on the host.

## Storage Volumes iSCSI and FC

When a Bare Metal host is set up with iSCSI or FC volumes, the storage volume should be automatically available.
